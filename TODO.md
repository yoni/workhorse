* Use a real logger
* Write more solvers 
* Persist problems and solutions
* Create a CouchDB datastore to persist problems and solutions
* Augment problem data structure to have a `status`. Status should support knowing if it has been distributed, if it's queued for distribution, or has been solved.
* Solution 'push' retries on failure.
